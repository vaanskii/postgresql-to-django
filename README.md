# Django Project with PostgreSQL Database

This Django project template includes the necessary configuration in `settings.py` to use PostgreSQL as the database backend.

## `settings.py` Explanation

In the `settings.py` file of your Django project, you'll find the `DATABASES` dictionary where you can configure the database settings. Here's what each key-value pair means:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  # Specifies the database engine (PostgreSQL in this case).
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',               # The name of your PostgreSQL database.
        'USER': 'your_database_user',               # The username used to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',       # The password used to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
        'HOST': '',                                 # The host where the PostgreSQL database is running (localhost in this case).
        'PORT': '',                                 # The port on which the PostgreSQL database is listening (default is 5432).
    }
}
```

Clone the repository.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Configure PostgreSQL connection in settings.py.
Run migrations (python manage.py migrate).

Additional Notes
Keep your sensitive information (such as database credentials) secure.
Customize the Django project according to your requirements.

You can save this text into a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your Django project. This README provides an explanation of the `settings.py` file contents, instructions for installing dependencies from the requirements.txt file, and setup steps for the Django project with PostgreSQL.
